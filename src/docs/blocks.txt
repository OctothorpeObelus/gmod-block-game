Metadata
    Metadata is the table passed into the registry containing all sorts of info for the block.

    Protected Values (used by the game, optional values)
        - func_place (Type function)
            - This is a function that is run when the block is initially placed in the world.
        - func_interact (Type function)
            - This is a function that is run when the player presses the interact key on the block
        - func_think (Type function)
            - This is a function that runs every frame if on the client and every tick if on the server
        - func_destroy (Type function)
            - This is a function that runs when the block is about to be removed from the world (in the same tick as destruction, but before deletion).
        - directional (Type string)
            - This determines if the block rotates to face the player when placed
            -Valid Values:
                - "none" or nil = The block stays in a fixed orientation (north-facing) when placed. If 'directional' is not defined, this is the default.
                                  This should be used if your func_place determines a custom directional placement not supported here.
                - "horizontal"  = The block rotates to face the player when placed, but only horizontally (will not rotate on pitch).
                - "vertical"    = The block rotates to face the player when placed, but only vertically (will not rotate on yaw).
                - "all"         = The block will rotate to face the player in both pitch and yaw.
